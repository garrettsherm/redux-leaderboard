## Create-react-app + Redux-thunk + bootstrap template

Barebones template using create-react-app, redux-thunk, & bootstrap

## Why?

I wanted to spend less time setting up my environment and more time coding. 

## Installation

Make sure you have the latest versions of node.js, npm, and yarn installed.

Clone this git directory.

Run 'npm install' to install dependencies. 

Run 'npm run dev' to get up and running on localhost:3000.

## Build

Run 'yarn build' to create an optimized build in './build' folder.

Run 'npm start' to serve application directly from build folder.
